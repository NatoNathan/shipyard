Added monorepo support with dependency graph management

Implemented comprehensive monorepo support with dependency tracking and topological ordering.

## Features

- Multiple package management in single repository
- Dependency graph construction and validation
- Cycle detection with detailed error reporting
- Topological sorting for correct build order
- Package-specific version tracking
- Independent or linked versioning strategies

## Dependency Strategies

- **fixed**: Pin to specific version (e.g., 1.2.3)
- **linked**: Follow parent package version exactly
- **independent**: Version independently

## Graph Operations

- Build dependency graph from configuration
- Detect circular dependencies
- Compute topological sort for processing order
- Find strongly connected components (Tarjan algorithm)
- Cache graph for performance

## Validation

- Validates package references exist
- Prevents circular dependencies
- Checks version strategy compatibility
- Reports detailed error locations
