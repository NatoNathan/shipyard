Add GitHub release integration to release and version commands

Introduces a new `release` command that creates GitHub releases via the GitHub
API, with support for draft mode (`--draft`). Release notes are automatically
generated from the shipyard history. The `version` command also gains `--release`
and `--draft` flags to optionally create a GitHub release immediately after tagging.

A new `internal/github` package provides a lightweight GitHub API client with
token resolution supporting the `env:VAR_NAME` format from shipyard config.
