Added version command for applying semantic version bumps

Implemented the version command to calculate and apply version bumps based on pending consignments.

## Features

- Automatic semantic version calculation from consignments
- Dependency-aware version propagation
- Updates version files across all affected packages
- Generates changelog entries
- Creates git tags for each version
- Archives processed consignments to history
- Dry-run mode with --preview flag

## Version Bumping

- Patch: x.y.Z increments (bug fixes)
- Minor: x.Y.0 increments (new features)
- Major: X.0.0 increments (breaking changes)
- Highest change type wins per package

## Git Integration

- Creates annotated tags (e.g., v1.2.3 or core-v1.2.3)
- Commits version file changes
- Preserves git history with detailed messages

## Safety

- Preview mode shows changes without applying
- Validates all consignments before processing
- Atomic operations with rollback on failure
- Warns about uncommitted changes
