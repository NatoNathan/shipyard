Added version propagation for dependency-aware versioning

Implemented automatic version propagation through dependency chains.

## Features

- Automatic version bumps for dependent packages
- Cascade propagation through dependency chains
- Strategy-aware propagation (linked vs fixed vs independent)
- Conflict detection and resolution
- Minimum version calculation across multiple dependencies
- Direct vs transitive dependency handling

## Propagation Rules

- **Linked dependencies**: Always match parent version
- **Fixed dependencies**: Update when parent changes
- **Independent**: No automatic propagation
- Multiple sources: Highest version wins

## Conflict Resolution

- Detects incompatible version requirements
- Reports conflict chains with full path
- Suggests resolution strategies
- Validates propagation results

## Use Cases

- Shared library updates propagate to consumers
- Breaking changes cascade appropriately
- Internal dependencies stay synchronized
- Prevent version skew in monorepos
